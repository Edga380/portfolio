            <p>Hello, I'm Edgaras. I have been living in London for almost a decade and have been working as a chef in a fusion
            asian restaurant for the past 8 years.</p>
            <p>From a young age I have always been interested in making things, technology and playing computer games.
            Fascinated by web development I taught myself how to create websites in my spare time.</p>
            <p>A few years ago I created a game on Android using Unity game engine called 'Bubble Space Wars'. 
            To showcase my work I decided to code my own website from scratch and in the process  
            I realised this was my true passion and decided to take the steps to change my career to web development.</p>
            <p>After hearing about the 'Founders and coders' bootcamp from a friend I knew it would be a great opportunity 
            I couldn't miss. Through this course I hope to develop my skills and broaden my knowledge in order to pursue 
            this as my career path.</p>
